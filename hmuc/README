Build from source files:
------------------------

Linux: 

1. In release.sh, update MROOT with the absolute directory location 

2. Make sure release.sh is executable (if not then 'chmod +x release.sh' will fix this)

3. run release.sh


Visual studio:

The solution file is hmuc.sln


Usage:
------
To run the solver simply type:

haifa-muc <benchmark file> [additional flags]

(type haifa-muc --help to see possible flags)

The format of the file is cnf (Dimacs cnf format).
